# Hi there, I'm Valerii 👋

I'm a Data Analyst with a strong focus on BI, automation, and data exploration. I work with ClickHouse, Superset, and Python to turn raw data into insights. I enjoy optimizing SQL queries, building alerting systems, and improving BI infrastructure across the company.

- 📊 Building dashboards and Slack alerts using [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/)
- ⚙️ Automating routine analytics tasks via Airflow and Python
- 📈 Optimizing ClickHouse queries for performance and clarity
- 👨‍🏫 Mentoring colleagues on SQL and BI tools fundamentals
